Presentation Script on PERT (For IT & System Analysis & Design)
Slide 1: Title

“Good morning/afternoon everyone.
Today I will be presenting on PERT – the Program Evaluation and Review Technique, especially its use in IT and System Analysis & Design.”

Slide 2: What is PERT?

“PERT is a project management tool used to plan and schedule complex projects.
In IT projects, many tasks have uncertain timelines, and PERT helps us estimate these more accurately.”

Slide 3: Why PERT is Important in IT

“In software development, delays can happen due to bugs, testing issues, or unclear requirements.
PERT helps by identifying dependencies, estimating realistic deadlines, and managing risk.”

Slide 4: PERT in SDLC

“PERT supports different phases of the System Development Life Cycle:
• In planning, we list all modules and tasks.
• In analysis, we understand task dependencies.
• In design, we estimate how long UI, backend, or database design will take.
• During development, PERT helps track progress.
• In testing, it helps schedule unit, integration, and system testing.”

Slide 5: Time Estimates (O, M, P)

“In PERT, we use three time estimates:
• Optimistic time – if everything goes smoothly.
• Most likely time – the normal case.
• Pessimistic time – if there are issues or delays.
The expected time is calculated using the formula:
(O + 4M + P) / 6.”

Slide 6: Steps to Create a PERT Chart

“To create a PERT chart:

List all IT tasks or modules.

Identify the correct sequence.

Draw the PERT network.

Estimate the time for each activity.

Identify the critical path.

Update it as the project progresses.”

Slide 7: Example IT Project Tasks

“For example, in a software project we may have tasks like requirements gathering, UI design, backend development, frontend development, API integration, testing, and deployment.”

Slide 8: Critical Path

“The critical path is the longest path through the project.
It determines the minimum time needed to complete the project.
If any task on the critical path is delayed, the entire project gets delayed.”

Slide 9: Advantages of PERT

“PERT helps in planning large IT projects better.
It improves accuracy, helps in decision-making, and reduces risks.
It also supports teamwork since everyone understands the timeline and dependencies.”

Slide 10: Conclusion

“To conclude, PERT is an essential tool in IT project management.
It helps system analysts and developers manage complex tasks, especially when timelines are uncertain.
Thank you.”
